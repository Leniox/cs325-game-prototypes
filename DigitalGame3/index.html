<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
For my second assignent, I focused on creating an environment from PNGs instead of Tile Map this time. I put a spin on DDR
and allowed you to shoot at the falling objects within a given time period. You have to match the arrow with the correct arrow

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
All of the environment is stitched together. I had to figure out how to randomly generate sprites and ensure that collision
of the sprites matched with the correct arrow collision which took time to figure out. In the future, I intend to add more levels
with differnt powerups.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The main components of Phaser
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
1. I learned how to use use PNGs as a background and how to exactly place an object and ensure collisions with 
groups align with those PNGs
2. Collisions with groups
3. Nothing was easy. Still figuring out what you can do with phaser. I'm going to add 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I borrowed some of the PNGs from online:

A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The story revovles around a thief sneaking into a high school to steal something but then is thrown onto the stage
and has to dance for his life of else he will be caught...?
