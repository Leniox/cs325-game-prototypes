<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I wanted to create a where the introduction of spawned enemies is completely random and have many different ways to tune them, such as the size
of the objects, the speed at which they fall, and other metrics</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The randomness introduced into the game in order to facilitate a good game experience. Also, some objects are smaller than others and are only
revealed if you move the objects out of the way</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to add music to the game and introduce many metrics that can be tuned
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I am not borrowing this from another example on phaser. </li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're in a hot air balloon and strange objects are starting to fall out of the sky. You're in luck! You can swipe them out of the way</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
You're trapped in a hot air balloon and need to survive the onslaught of objects</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    the size and rows of objects are random
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
random generation of sprites and swipe</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to experience a fun and exciting game</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The mechanics are simple. I want the player to just swipe away. Right now, the collision is only working from the bottom. On the next iteration,
I'd like the player to truly swipe away instead of bump the objects off the screen. Also next game I am going to add a boss phase for round 3 and an objective at the end of that phase
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
They have to act fast to swipe away
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?

The story is that you're embarking on a scientific research and discovery mission that requires a hot air balloon. But as you are rising ,you are invaded
but random alien-like shapes and objects and must not be hit by them.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bored people</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 minutes</li>
