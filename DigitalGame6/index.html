<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
For the first iteration, I wanted to mess around with the rotational aspect of Phaser. This is not exactly what I wanted
but it is something I am going to imrpove upon next time. I want the tangental velocity of the rotation around the balls to
move with that speed and in that same direction tangent to rotation. I couldn't figure out how to do that yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This one involved a few pieces of math and trying to figure out how to collide and include rotation in it

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The main components of Phaser
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
1. The hardest part was figuring out the timing of all of the new objects I created and how to make sure the score
and expiration of powers worked smoothly. I also had to make sure the powers work.
groups align with those PNGs
2. Collision and timing of the game
3. Nothing was easy. Still figuring out what you can do with phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I borrowed some of the PNGs from online:


<ul>

<li>Bad guy sprite: <a href="http://pixelartmaker.com/art/caf489e942cb61f">badGuy</a></li>
<li>Tether ball: <a href="http://articleinsanity.wikia.com/wiki/Tether_Ball">tether</a></li>





</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    ??
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Must kill the bad guys using the ability to tether to objects
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Platformer with rotation
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Random placement on creation of tethers and enemies </li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Random sprite creation with collisions

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
To have fun
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    click to tether to a ball
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Use your rotations in a smart way to kill everything ast. I think I would love to improve by setting some timer.

</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You find yourself as a phaser logo and you have to kill the bad guys trying to take oover phaser HQ. DO it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'm trying to reach high schoolers playing games in their computer lab classes.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
