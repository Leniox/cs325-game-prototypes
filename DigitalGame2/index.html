<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
For my second assignent, I focused on creating an original tilemap using Tile and creating custom collisions within Tiled
and then mapping them onto Phaser. Also you can shoot laser beams if you hit spacebar and kill cars.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
All of the map is custom built by me. I had to figure out how to use Tiled and import all of the required resources. 
I had to then map all of the collisions on by one. And then I had to make sure that all of the sprites ended up in the exact
spot. Having not use Tiled or Phaser before, it took 5+ hours doing all of the map and tiled tutorials.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The main components of Phaser
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
1. I learned how to use Tiled and how I should create several functions to facilitate ease of code writing
2. Collisions
3. Nothing was easy. The process is tedius and takes a lot of time investment. Hardest part was figuring out Phaser
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I borrowed some of the PNGs from the master branch of the Phaser Examples Github
Yes, I borrowed some of the PNGs from open source tile map websites and from this github

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I took from frogger
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You have to get to the otherside of the map without being run over.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Why did the chicken cross the road
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
randomness in car speed after death</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Game collision
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
It's almost flappy bird-esque in the boxes I set around the cars so I want it to be frustrating but obtainable.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
You can move around using the arrow keys and can fire lasers using spacebar
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Don't get run over by the car! Try to rack up points
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The story revovles around a lone chicken who only wants to cross the road. The world is cruel and tries to run him over.
Road kill is a prized posession in this world. Don't be road kill.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'm trying to reach high schoolers playing games in their computer lab classes.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
</li>
