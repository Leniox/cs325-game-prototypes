<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
For the second iteration of this game, I added power ups and tuning of the game mechanics. The three powers I added allows
the player to slow-down time, increase speed, and then extra jumping. During jumping, you can collide with arrows to blow
them up. I also added pirate mobs that try to ruin the school play. You can counter this by shooting them off screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
For the technical merit on this project, I had to navigate the timing, implementation, and expiration of powerups. Moreover, 
I had to add an andditional game mechanic to push pirates out of the screen and increase scores accordingly.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The main components of Phaser
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
1. The hardest part was figuring out the timing of all of the new objects I created and how to make sure the score
and expiration of powers worked smoothly. I also had to make sure the powers work.
groups align with those PNGs
2. Collision and timing of the game
3. Nothing was easy. Still figuring out what you can do with phaser.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
I borrowed some of the PNGs from online:

High School dance contest... with invading pirates?
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
randomness of placement and speed of arrows
randomness of powers and increase of difficulty as the time goes on</li>
